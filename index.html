                    <p>Welcome to <em>My Personal Portfolio</em>. I am a college student with major in <em>Computer Science</em>. My primary programming language is C++. I decided to learn HTML because I really want to create my own website. My short-term plan is to create a basic website, and my long-term plan is to create a web-based application which is a combination of web development and software development.</p>
